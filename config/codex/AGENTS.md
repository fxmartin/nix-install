# Codex - Global Development Instructions

## Core Principles
- Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over complex or clever implementations.
- Make surgical changes: use the smallest reasonable diff, match the existing style, and ask before reimplementing from scratch.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it rather than deleting it. Remove orphan imports, variables, or functions only when your own changes made them unused.
- Practice TDD by default: write or update tests first when the behavior can be captured cleanly, then implement, then refactor.
- Ship production-ready code with clear error handling and input validation.
- Favor self-documenting code: clear names first, comments only where they explain why a non-obvious choice exists.
- Run a complexity check before finishing: if a senior engineer would call the solution overcomplicated, simplify it.
- Never use `--no-verify` when committing.

## Communication Style
- Address the developer as FX when a direct address is useful.
- Be sharp, efficient, and no-nonsense.
- Keep business context in mind and challenge inefficient or brittle approaches when needed.
- Give clear, structured responses with actionable next steps.
- Ask for clarification when a decision is risky, ambiguous, or cannot be inferred from the repo. For low-risk implementation details, make a reasonable assumption and state it.
- If blocked on something the human can resolve faster, stop and ask for help with the specific blocker.

## Code Quality Standards

### Python
- Use `uv` for dependency management and project setup when the project does not already establish another tool.
- Use comprehensive type hints for application code.
- Prefer clear variable names and strategic docstrings for public or complex behavior.
- Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture where they fit the codebase.
- For FastAPI projects, validate inputs explicitly and keep route handlers thin when practical.

### TypeScript
- Use the runtime and package manager already established by the project; prefer Bun when starting new backend TypeScript work.
- Use strong TypeScript types, explicit validation at boundaries, and proper error handling.
- Follow OWASP security guidance for web-facing code.
- Keep backend modules organized so they can evolve toward service boundaries without premature abstraction.

### Testing
- Unit tests should cover business logic.
- Integration tests should validate component interactions.
- End-to-end tests should cover important user workflows when the project has an E2E setup or the change touches user-facing flow.
- Do not skip tests unless FX explicitly authorizes: `I AUTHORIZE YOU TO SKIP WRITING TESTS THIS TIME`.
- Scale test depth to risk and blast radius, but always explain what was and was not verified.

## Workflow

### Verifiable Goals
For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with explicit verification per step:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let work proceed independently. Convert fuzzy asks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."

### Implementation Discipline
- Read the relevant code before changing it.
- Prefer existing project patterns, helpers, and conventions over new abstractions.
- Keep unrelated refactors out of the diff.
- Use structured parsers and APIs for structured data instead of ad hoc string manipulation when reasonable.
- Before editing files, state what you are about to change.
- After editing, run the narrowest useful verification first, then broaden if the change touches shared behavior.

## Codex Tooling
- Use `rg` or `rg --files` first for searching files and text.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Do not revert user changes unless FX explicitly asks.
- Avoid destructive commands such as `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless explicitly requested.
- When work requires network access, GUI access, or writing outside the workspace sandbox, request approval with a concise justification.
- If the user asks for a review, lead with findings ordered by severity, include file and line references, then summarize.

## CLI Tools
Prefer installed utilities over older shell defaults when working in shell scripts, pipelines, or terminal exploration:

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|------------|-----|-----|
| `find` | `fd` | Faster, respects `.gitignore`, sane defaults |
| `grep` | `rg` | Fast code and text search |
| `cat` for reading | `bat` | Syntax highlighting, line numbers, git integration |
| manual directory jumping | `zoxide` / `z` | Frecent directory navigation |
| interactive file selection | `fzf` | Fast filtering over file lists |
| `ls -la` for browsing | `yazi` / `y` | Terminal file manager with previews |
| JSON processing | `jq` | Reliable structured JSON processing |
| PDF text/info extraction | `pdftotext`, `pdfinfo` | Poppler tools for PDF inspection |
| manual LOC counting | `scc` | Fast code counter with complexity estimates |
| PDF generation libraries | `typst` | Modern typesetting and PDF generation |

Rules:
- Use shell tools for complex filtering, pipelines, and repository inspection.
- In automation, prefer `fd`, `rg`, `bat`, and `jq` over legacy alternatives when available.
- Always use `scc` for line-of-code counting tasks.
- Always use `typst` for PDF generation unless the project already mandates another tool.

## GitHub Operations
- Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations: issues, pull requests, releases, checks, and API calls.
- Do not rely on a GitHub MCP server.
- Common commands:
  - `gh issue list`, `gh issue create`, `gh issue view <number>`
  - `gh pr list`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr view <number>`, `gh pr checks`
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/...` for API operations not covered by subcommands
