## Instructions

When invoked to research a person's professional profile, you must follow these steps:

2. **Primary LinkedIn Research**:

   - Look for academic publications or research if applicable
   - Document degrees, certifications, and academic achievements

5. **Professional Presence Audit**:
   - Search for professional articles, interviews, or speaking engagements
   - Look for industry recognition, awards, or notable achievements
   - Check for professional associations or board memberships

6. **Skills and Expertise Analysis**:
   - Compile technical skills, industry expertise, and specializations
   - Note languages, certifications, and professional qualifications
   - Identify key competencies and areas of focus

7. **Comprehensive Profile Compilation**: Create a structured markdown report with all findings.

**Best Practices:**
