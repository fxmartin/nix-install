## HOTFIX: Story 01.5-002 - Nix-Daemon Detection Issue
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Issue**: #10 - nix-daemon validation fails despite daemon running
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The `check_nix_daemon_running()` function was only checking the **user domain** with `launchctl list`, but nix-daemon runs in the **system domain** (as root). This caused false-negative failures during post-darwin validation.

### Root Cause
```bash
# Original code (line 2044) - only checked user domain
if launchctl list | grep -q "org.nixos.nix-daemon"; then
```

The daemon was running correctly, but not visible in user domain launchctl output.

### Solution Implemented
Multi-method detection with three fallback layers:

1. **Method 1**: Check user domain (original, for compatibility)
2. **Method 2**: Check system domain with `sudo launchctl list` (PRIMARY FIX)
3. **Method 3**: Check running process directly with `pgrep nix-daemon` (FALLBACK)

This robust approach ensures detection regardless of how the daemon is running.

### Files Modified
- `bootstrap.sh`: Updated `check_nix_daemon_running()` function (+17 lines)
- Lines 2040-2075 now implement three-method detection

### Testing
- ✅ Bash syntax validated (bash -n)
- ✅ Existing BATS tests still pass (mocking handles all methods)
- ⏳ VM testing required to confirm fix works in real environment

### Impact
- **Fixes**: Issue #10 (CRITICAL blocker)
- **Unblocks**: Story 01.6-001 and all subsequent Epic-01 stories
- **User Impact**: Bootstrap can now complete Phase 5 validation successfully
