Use the sub-agent professional-profile-researcher for the name provided as a parameter. If no name is provided then ask for it.

Save the results into one single markdown file in the folder Profile_Summary with a filename made of Profile_Summary + Name + current date. If the file already exists then append a sequential number after the date.

If multiple names are provided in the parameter launch multiple sub-agents in parallel and generate a separate markdown file for each.
