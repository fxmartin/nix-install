Use the sub-agent executive-summary-generator for the client provided as a parameter. If no client's name is provided then ask for it.

Save the results into one single markdown file in the folder Executive_Summary with a filename made of Brief_Summary + Client's name + current date. If the file already exists then append a sequential number after the date.

If multiple clients are provided in the parameter launch multiple sub-agents in parallel and generate a separate markdown file for each.
